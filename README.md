Buy low, sell high.

Transactions:
  implement selling for transactions!!!!
    need to build portfolio state,
    check if quantity you're selling is lte current quantity
    then calculate new cash balance
    update portfolio
    

  build links to table headers that take you to transactions page with query string
  then, sort array appropriately
  shouldn't be too bad
